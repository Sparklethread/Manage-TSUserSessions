# Manage-TSUserSessions

Function: 
The Manage-TSUserSessions PowerShell function is designed to aid server administrators in managing user sessions across multiple terminal servers. The function is designed to retrieve logged-in user session information from a list of terminal servers, display this information in an easily digestible grid format, and allow for the forced logoff of a selected user from a specified server.

Key features include:

Multi-Server Compatibility: The function is designed to work with multiple terminal servers, allowing for simultaneous management of user sessions across all servers.

User Session Overview: The function presents a grid overview of user sessions across all specified servers, displaying whether a user is logged in on a particular server.

Selective User Logoff: After displaying the session information, the function allows for the selection of a specific user and server for forced logoff. This provides a straightforward and intuitive method of managing user sessions.

Usage:
Preparing Server List: Prepare a text file with the list of your terminal servers. Each server should be on a new line in the text file.

Running the Function: Run the Manage-TSUserSessions function in PowerShell. You'll need to replace "C:\path\to\your\file.txt" with the actual path to your server list file.

Reading the Output: The output will be displayed in a grid format, with each row representing a user and each column representing a server. An "X" in a cell indicates that the user is logged in to that server.

Logging Off a User: After viewing the output, select the user that you wish to log off, then select the server from which they should be logged off.

Note:
Please remember to use this function responsibly. Forcing a logoff will terminate all of the user's running processes on the server, and could result in lost work if the user has not saved their progress. Be sure to notify users in advance if possible.

This function requires appropriate administrator permissions to function correctly, due to the nature of the quser and logoff commands, as well as the need to perform actions remotely.

Ensure that the user running this function has necessary permissions, and remember that network conditions, server settings, and user rights might impact the function's operation.
